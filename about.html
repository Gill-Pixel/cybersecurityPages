    <h1>Common ways the Malware is delivered!</h1>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="block">
            <p>Email: Sending out malware through email is simple and effective for a cybercriminal. 
                Emails may appear to come from trusted sources such as the user’s bank or credit card company, 
                or even a contact within the user’s list. The email will feature an appealing link or attachment that, 
                if clicked on, will direct the user toward a seemingly legitimate version of a trusted website, 
                convincing the user to change a password and send login information to the cybercriminal.  
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>Websites: A cybercriminal may design pop-up ads that warn users they have a virus to entice the user 
                into clicking “OK” to clean their system. Clicking OK installs the virus on the host system. 
                Even going to an unsecure website provides an opportunity for a virus to be downloaded. 
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>Phone: Users may receive a call from a cybercriminal claiming to be tech support, 
                stating a virus has been detected on one or more electronic device, and requesting permission to access that device remotely. 
                The cybercriminal will then download a virus, hijack the device, and steal personal and confidential information. 
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>Apps: A cybercriminal may insert malicious code in a popular app, and then advertise it as a free app for downloading.
                Once the user downloads the app, the malware infects the device.
