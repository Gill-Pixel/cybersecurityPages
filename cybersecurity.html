                <h1>Things to Do for prevention of Malware:</h1>
                <ol>download a trusted ad-blocker to enable the deviceâ€™s browser to block advertisements and pop-ups.</ol>
                <ol>visit secure websites only, where the web address starts with https://. (The S indicates secure.)</ol>
                <ol>install applications from trusted sources, reviewing the vendor prior to downloading.</ol>
                <ol>install and regularly update trusted anti-virus or anti-malware software. 
                    The security software that comes built into a device covers the basics, but it cannot always stop new, advanced, 
                    or rapidly-evolving threats.</ol>
                <ol>set up account alerts for online banking to be notified when account updates occur.</ol>
                <ol>change system login ID and password frequently. Do the same for any personal accounts such bank or credit card online accounts.</ol>
                <ol>nstall a virtual private network (VPN). By running the internet connection through an encrypted channel, the VPN protects data even when it is in transit.
                    Be aware of current and popular scams that trick users into unknowingly downloading the virus.</ol>
                <ol>back up devices regularly. Backing up files keeps them in an offline location that is not connected to the internet. 
                    This will help protect users if they lose access to data due to malware.</ol>
